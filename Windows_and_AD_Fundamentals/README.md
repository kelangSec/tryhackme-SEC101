Windows & Active Directory Fundamentals – TryHackMe SEC101

This folder contains all my notes, lab write-ups, and screenshots for the Windows and Active Directory section of TryHackMe Security 101.

Windows environments dominate enterprise networks. Understanding Windows internals and Active Directory is essential for SOC (Blue Team), Incident Response, and Offensive Security roles.

The goal of this section is to build strong knowledge of Windows operating systems, user management, authentication mechanisms, and domain environments.

📂 Folder Structure

Each lab/room in this section has its own folder:

windows-fundamentals-1

windows-fundamentals-2

windows-fundamentals-3

active-directory-basics

Inside each room folder:

windows-fundamentals-01.md → My summarized notes and key commands

windows-fundamentals-01-complete.png → Lab screenshots / evidence of hands-on work

All future Windows and AD rooms will follow the same structure for consistency.
