# Windows Fundamentals 1

## Overview

This room introduces the foundational concepts of the Windows operating system.  
The goal is to understand Windows editions, system navigation, the file system, user accounts, and basic system tools.

## 1. Windows Editions

Common Windows editions include:

- Windows Home  
- Windows Pro  
- Windows Enterprise  
- Windows Server  

Enterprise and Server editions are commonly used in corporate environments.  
Some security features (e.g., BitLocker encryption) are only available in Pro or Enterprise editions.

## 2. The Desktop (GUI)

Key components of the Windows graphical user interface (GUI):

- Desktop  
- Start Menu  
- Taskbar  
- Notification Area  
- File Explorer  

File Explorer is used to navigate files and folders within the system.  
Understanding the GUI helps with navigation, system management, and troubleshooting.

## 3. Introduction to Windows

- Provides a virtual machine for lab exercises  
- Explore system navigation and basic configuration tools  
- Gain familiarity with the Windows environment and settings  

## 4. The File System

Windows primarily uses **NTFS (New Technology File System)**.  

Key features:

- File and folder permissions  
- Encryption (EFS)  
- Compression  
- Auditing  
- Large file support  

NTFS permissions are important in enterprise security and privilege management.

## 5. The Windows \System32 Folders

- Located at `C:\Windows\System32`  
- Contains critical system executables, libraries, and configuration files  
- Understanding these folders is important for system investigation and security analysis  

## 6. User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions

- Types of user accounts: Administrator, Standard User, Guest  
- User profiles store settings and preferences  
- Permissions control access to files, folders, and system functions  
- Proper permissions prevent unauthorized access  

## 7. User Account Control (UAC)

- Helps prevent unauthorized system changes  
- Prompts for approval when elevated privileges are required  
- Reduces the risk of malware executing with administrator privileges  

## 8. Settings and the Control Panel

The Control Panel and Settings app allow users to:

- Manage user accounts  
- Configure system and network settings  
- Adjust display and personalization options  
- Uninstall or manage programs  

They are central for managing system configuration.

## 9. Task Manager

Task Manager allows you to:

- View running processes  
- Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage  
- End unresponsive programs  
- Manage startup applications  

Shortcut:  

Ctrl + Shift + Esc


## 10. Conclusion

- Windows editions determine available features and security options  
- The GUI helps navigate and manage the system efficiently  
- NTFS and System32 folders are key to security and functionality  
- User accounts, permissions, and UAC enforce system protection  
- Control Panel, Settings, and Task Manager provide essential management tools
