# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals – Part 1 Notes

## Why Linux Matters
- Widely used in servers, cloud, and enterprise systems
- Open-source and highly customizable
- Most cybersecurity tools run on Linux
- Essential for SOC, Blue Team, and Pentesting roles

---

## First Interaction with Linux
- Accessed a Linux machine through the terminal
- Used the shell to execute commands
- Understood how the command line communicates with the OS

---

## Basic Linux Commands

pwd      → Show current directory  
ls       → List files and folders  
ls -a    → Show hidden files  
cd       → Change directory  
cat      → View file contents  
touch    → Create a new file  
mkdir    → Create a directory  
rm       → Remove files/directories  

---

## Filesystem Navigation
- Linux uses a hierarchical directory structure
- Absolute path → Starts from root (/)
- Relative path → Based on current directory

---

## Searching for Data

find  → Locate files and directories  
grep  → Search for specific text patterns inside files  

- Useful for:
  - Log analysis
  - Finding sensitive files
  - Investigations
  - System auditing

---

## Shell Operators

&&  → Execute next command if previous succeeds  
||  → Execute next command if previous fails  
>   → Redirect output (overwrite)  
>>  → Redirect output (append)  

- Shell operators improve efficiency and allow command chaining.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Linux proficiency is mandatory in cybersecurity.
- Command-line skills increase speed and efficiency.
- Searching and navigating effectively saves time.
- Consistent practice makes commands natural.
