Welcome to my TryHackMe Security 101 repository.

This repo documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning journey as I build skills toward becoming a *SOC Analyst* and *Pentester*.  

Instead of just completing labs, I:
- ✅ Take structured notes  
- ✅ Save screenshots  
- ✅ Document commands  
- ✅ Write scripts  
- ✅ Explain concepts in my own words  

The goal is simple:  
*Learn deeply → Practice daily → Document everything → Grow publicly*

## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm Boris (KelangSec) 👋

I’m a cybersecurity learner from *Cameroon* focused on:  
- SOC (Security Operations Center)  
- Blue Team defense  
- Offensive security / Pentesting  
- System & network security  
- Threat detection & analysis  

I believe in *learning in public* and improving one lab at a time.
